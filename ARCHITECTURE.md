# Architecture

This document describes the internal architecture of biomelab for contributors
and AI coding agents. For user-facing features, see [README.md](README.md).

## Key dependencies

- **Fyne v2.7** -- Desktop GUI framework (requires CGo).
- **go-git v6** (unreleased, from main branch) -- All git operations. Uses `x/plumbing/worktree` for linked worktree support.
- **gopsutil** -- Cross-platform process detection for agent and IDE matching.
- **gh CLI** -- External tool for GitHub PR status (not a Go dependency).
- **glab CLI** -- External tool for GitLab MR status.

## Data flow

1. On startup, `main.go` expands PATH (for GUI launch from Spotlight), embeds the icon, loads config, and auto-adds the current repo.
2. `gui.App.Run()` creates the Fyne window, builds the content (repo panel + dashboard), registers keyboard handlers via `desktop.Canvas.SetOnKeyDown`, sets up the system tray, and starts the event loop.
3. Each repo's `RefreshManager` runs goroutine tickers: local refresh (5s) for dirty/agents/IDE/sandbox status, network refresh (configurable, default 30s) for git fetch + PR lookup.
4. Refresh results are delivered via `fyne.Do(func() { dashboard.ApplyRefresh(result) })` to ensure all UI mutations happen on the main thread.
5. `Dashboard.Rebuild()` recreates the card widgets from current `RepoState`. Cards are sorted alphabetically by branch name.
6. The repo panel uses tappable VBox items (not `widget.Tree`) to avoid stealing keyboard focus.

## Keyboard handling

Fyne's keyboard event delivery has several constraints:
- `Canvas.SetOnTypedKey/Rune` only fires when `canvas.Focused() == nil`
- `Canvas.AddShortcut` with `Modifier: 0` doesn't dispatch (Fyne requires modifier != 0)
- `widget.Tree` implements Focusable and steals focus on click
- `fyne.KeyEvent` carries no modifier info (can't distinguish 's' from 'S')

The solution:
- **No Focusable widgets** in the content tree (repo panel uses tappable labels, not widget.Tree)
- **`desktop.Canvas.SetOnKeyDown`** handles all keys (fires before Tab interception)
- **`Canvas.SetOnTypedRune`** handles only Shift+S and Shift+P (case-sensitive)
- **Zoom shortcuts** use `Canvas.AddShortcut` with Ctrl/Cmd modifier (which works)
- **Dialog Escape** calls `dialog.Hide()` (never `overlays.Remove` which corrupts state)

## Async pattern

All blocking operations (git fetch, sandbox status, PR lookup) run in goroutines.
Results are delivered to the UI via `fyne.Do(func() { ... })`. The `RefreshManager`
uses `context.Context` for pause/resume when switching repos.

## macOS GUI considerations

When launched from Spotlight/Finder (not terminal), the process gets a minimal
PATH (`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`). The `init()` function in `main.go`
expands PATH to include `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `~/.docker/bin`,
etc. This is required for `sbx`, `gh`, `glab`, `code`, and other CLI tools.

## System tray

The app lives in the system tray. Closing the window hides it (not quit).
The tray menu toggles between "Show" and "Hide" based on window visibility.
"Quit" stops all refresh managers and exits.

## Config format

`~/.config/biomelab/repos.json`:

```go
type ModeEntry struct {
    Type        string // "regular" or "sandbox"
    SandboxName string
    Agent       string
}
type RepoEntry struct {
    Path  string
    Name  string
    Modes []ModeEntry
}
```

The old flat format (with `Sandbox bool`) is auto-migrated on load.

## Task notes

Each worktree has two optional artifact files that biomelab reads during the
Send PR flow. The package is `internal/notes/`.

| Path                                | Purpose                            |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `<worktree>/.biomelab/note.md`      | PR description — free-form Markdown |
| `<worktree>/.biomelab/pr-title.md`  | PR title — single line              |

**Contract**

- Files live **inside** the worktree, so they're mounted into the sandbox
  microVM alongside the source. Agents running in the sandbox read them as
  ordinary files at the worktree root.
- On first save, biomelab appends `/.biomelab/` to the **common gitdir's**
  `info/exclude` (resolved via `<wt-gitdir>/commondir` for linked worktrees).
  The per-worktree `info/exclude` file created by `git worktree add` is
  **not** consulted by `git status` / `git check-ignore` — verified
  empirically. One exclude entry covers both files in every worktree of the
  repo; idempotent on repeat writes.
- `note.md` (`notes.Write`): trailing whitespace is stripped and the file
  ends in a single newline. All-whitespace input is treated as a delete.
- `pr-title.md` (`notes.WriteTitle`): whitespace runs (including embedded
  newlines and tabs) are collapsed to single spaces via
  `strings.Fields` + `Join`, so the file is always one clean line + newline.
  Empty-after-collapse input is treated as a delete. `notes.ReadTitle`
  returns the first non-empty line.

**Lifecycle**

- Created on save from the editor (`m` key or right-click → editor → Save,
  or Cmd/Ctrl+S).
- Deleted when the user clears the corresponding field and saves, clicks
  "Delete note" in the editor (removes both files after confirmation), or
  removes the worktree (`ops.RemoveWorktree` wipes the entire directory).
- Survives sandbox restarts because the artifact dir is part of the mounted
  worktree, not container-only state.

**Extension point**

Any external tool can populate these paths and biomelab picks them up at PR
send time. The flow: when the user presses `Shift+P` and the confirm dialog
shows the **Use task notes for the PR title and description** checkbox
(rendered when either file exists), ticking it makes biomelab pass

```
gh pr create --title <pr-title.md content> --body-file <note.md path> --head <branch>
```

(or the `glab mr create --title ... --description-file ...` equivalent on
GitLab). Either side falls back to the commit-derived default when the
corresponding file is absent. When the checkbox is unticked, biomelab falls
back to `--fill` for both — the note files are ignored, not removed.

This contract is what the [`/pr-scribe`](https://github.com/mdelapenya/coding-skills)
skill (and similar tools) target: write the generated title and description
to those two paths, and biomelab turns them into the actual PR on the next
`Shift+P`.

## re_gent integration

[re_gent](https://github.com/regent-vcs/re_gent) captures every agent turn
(prompt, reply, tool calls) into a content-addressed `.regent/` directory
per worktree. Biomelab wraps it so the integration is invisible until the
user installs `rgt`:

- **Auto-init on host worktrees.** `ops.CreateWorktree` runs
  `regent.EnsureInit` after every new worktree creation, and
  `app.buildRepoEntry` walks existing worktrees on startup
  (`migrateRegentForRepo`) so an `rgt install` retroactively wires up
  every regular-mode worktree on the next refresh. Sandbox worktrees
  skip this path — rgt belongs inside the container, installed via the
  regent kit.
- **`EnsureInit` runs `rgt init --skip-hook --skip-skills`** with
  `cmd.Dir = wtPath`. `rgt init` ignores positional path args and always
  operates on `cwd`, so `cmd.Dir` is mandatory. The `--skip-hook` flag is
  used because rgt's interactive installer needs a TTY biomelab can't
  provide; we install Claude hooks ourselves.
- **`EnsureClaudeHooks` writes `.claude/settings.json`** with three event
  hooks (`UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `PostToolBatch`) pointing at
  `rgt message-hook` / `rgt tool-batch-hook`. Idempotent: rgt-related
  entries are deduplicated on each call, non-rgt entries are preserved.
  The JSON shape is ported from rgt's own installer
  (`internal/cli/init.go`, Apache-2.0, attributed in source).
- **Git exclude.** `git.EnsureExcluded` writes `/.regent/` (and
  `/.biomelab/`) to the worktree's common `info/exclude` so neither
  directory shows up in `git status`. Extracted to `internal/git` so
  both `notes` and `regent` share one helper (used to live in `notes`,
  caused a `git → notes` import that prevented `notes → git`).
- **Log viewer.** `l` shortcut opens `regent_log_dialog.go`, a single
  top-level resizable window. Content comes from `rgt log --json`
  (parsed in `internal/regent/log_json.go`) and renders structured rows:
  `sha · timestamp · origin`, `Human:` prompt, `Agent:` reply, then a
  `▶ N tools` toggle that reveals one row per tool call with the
  primary arg inline (file_path / command / query) and the rest below.
  Full file paths, no truncation. Single window: pressing `l` on a
  different card reuses the open window (`App.regentLogWindow` +
  `regentLogReload`).
- **JSON export.** The window's `Export JSON…` button calls
  `regent.LogJSONRaw` and saves the bytes via the OS-native save dialog
  helper (`gui/save_file.go`: osascript on macOS, zenity/kdialog on
  Linux, PowerShell on Windows; falls back to `dialog.NewFileSave`).

## System dependencies

`internal/sysdeps` is the registry of external CLIs biomelab cares
about. Each `Check` has a `Probe` that returns `Result{Status, Version,
Note}`; a `Cache` (default TTL 30s) memoizes results across the systray
menu, the dialog, and the first-run banner.

Two filtering layers apply before rendering:

- `ApplySuppression` drops `Missing` entries whose `SuppressIfAny` list
  names another check that is currently `OK` or `Degraded`. Used so
  `glab missing` doesn't appear when `gh` is installed.
- `ApplyVisibility` drops `Missing` entries whose `Applies(cfg)` callback
  says the tool isn't relevant. Used so `sbx` doesn't appear at all
  when the user has no sandbox-mode repo. **Important:** `Applies`
  gates visibility of missing entries only — installed tools always
  show as green even when the user's config doesn't strictly need them.
  That way `sbx v0.29.0` is reported correctly on machines where the
  user just happens to have it.
- `Partition` splits the surviving entries into a primary list and an
  optional list (`Optional && Missing`). The dialog renders the
  primary list at the top and the optional list (currently just `rgt`)
  under an "Optional tools" heading.

The systray label is `Dependencies: N/M ✓` (or
`Dependencies: N/M (X need attention)`), where N/M counts only the
visible primary entries. Clicking opens the dialog; the dialog's
**Re-check** button invalidates the cache and refreshes the systray
label in one call.

## Pitfalls

- go-git v6 is a pseudo-version. Do NOT use a `replace` directive.
- `sandbox.StatusNotFound` is 0 (iota). Use `HasSbxStatus` flag, not `!= 0`.
- `canvas.Text` doesn't clip. Truncate strings manually.
- Dialog `onDone` callback must fire on BOTH confirm and cancel.
- `widget.Button` implements Focusable — don't put buttons in the main content.
- IDE `ProcessPatterns` order matters: specific before broad (`"nvim"` before `"vim"`).
- Always bounds-check `a.active < len(a.repos)` before accessing repos.
- `rgt init` ignores positional path args and operates on `cwd`. Use `cmd.Dir`, not `rgt init <path>`.
- `rgt init` hook installer needs a TTY; biomelab writes `.claude/settings.json` itself via `regent.EnsureClaudeHooks`. Don't rely on `--agent claude` to skip the prompt — it doesn't.
- `widget.Accordion` misbehaves inside `container.NewVScroll` (clicks don't toggle). Use a button + visibility toggle instead — see the regent log dialog's tools collapsible.
- The shared regent log window is keyed by `App.regentLogWindow` (single instance). Don't spawn a new window per worktree; reuse via `regentLogReload`.
